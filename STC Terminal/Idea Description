The most important long-term aim of Student Coin is to create the tokens for every single university, that will be based on Student Coin â€“ as the reference currency. Partner student organizations, universities, and students will have access to the open-source tool called STC Terminal, which will allow easy creation and management of their tokens as Oxford Student Token or Stanford Student Token. What is more, the tokens will be freely traded at incoming STC Exchange to STC, in pairs as OXF/STC or STN/STC.
